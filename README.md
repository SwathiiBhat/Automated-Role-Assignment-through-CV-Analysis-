## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Upload resumes in **PDF** or **TXT** formats.
- 🧽 Clean and preprocess resume text using NLP techniques.
- 🧠 Classify resumes into predefined **job categories** using a **KNN classifier**.
- 📊 Extract **skills**, **qualifications**, and **years of experience**.
- 📈 Compute **resume-job match percentage** using **Cosine Similarity**.
- ⚠️ Detect **plagiarism** across resumes using **Fuzzy Matching**.
- 💻 Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
